  By pleading you will be giving up the following rights:

  * To be represented by an attorney employed by you;
  * To have a speedy and public trial in front of a judge;
  * To testify, to present evidence, and to use court orders without cost to compel the attendance of witnesses and the production of evidence on your behalf;
  * To have the witnesses against you testify under oath in court, and to question such witnesses;
  * To remain silent and not testify and not incriminate yourself.

  datatype: radio
  choices:
  - No Contest Plea. I have read, understand, and waive the rights above, there are facts to support my plea, I am entering my plea freely and voluntarily, and I agree to plead “no contest”. I understand that, for purposes of this case, a plea of no contest will be considered the same as a plea of guilty and that if I plead no contest the court will find me guilty.: agree_no_contest
  - Guilty Plea. I have read, understand, and waive the rights above, there are facts to support my plea. I am entering my plea freely and voluntarily, and agree to plead guilty.: agree_guilty
