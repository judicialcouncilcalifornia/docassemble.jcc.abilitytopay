  This code block indicates that citation_pleas should be considered "gathered" when
  it contains values for all unadjudicated citations. This is weird docassemble semantics.
  Docassemble searches for a block that defines citation_pleas.gathered. It finds this one
  and tries to execute it. In order to get all the way to the `citation_pleas.gathered = True` statement,
  it first has to find values for citation_pleas[citation_number] for all unadjudicated citation numbers.

  selected_citations = [
    all_citations[citation_number]
    for citation_number in selected_citation_numbers.true_values()

    if not c.get('adjudicated')

  for citation in unadjudicated_citations:
    citation_pleas[citation['citationNumber']]
